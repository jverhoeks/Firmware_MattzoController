// This file needs to stay in the folder of the firmware for the specific MattzoController!

// Handling of different configurations:
//		It's a good idea to create copies for all the controllers of this type that you own.
//		Before compiling and uploading the firmware, just include the correct configuration into the firmware code.
//		This allows to manage specific configurations for the different controllers easily.

// Best practice:
// 1. Create a copy of this file if required (see above).
// 2. Go through the settings below and update the settings as required.
