// This file needs to stay in the folder of the firmware for the specific MattzoController!

// Handling of different configurations:
//		It's a good idea to create copies for all the controllers of this type that you own.
//		Before compiling and uploading the firmware, just include the correct configuration into the firmware code.
//		This allows to manage specific configurations for the different controllers easily.

// Best practice:
// 1. Create a copy of this file if required (see above).
// 2. Go through the settings below and update the settings as required.

// Motor shields
// *************
// Motor shields are usually electronical components attached to the MattzoTrainController.
// They are controlled via PWM signals from the controller and handle the higher currents required
// for train motors.
// Beside those physically existing motor shields, they are also partly or completely virtual motor shields as:
// - LEGO_IR_8884, and
// - WIFI_TRAIN_RECEIVER_4DBRIX
// It is important to note that one train can have MULTIPLE motor shields attached to it. This is relevant for the following scenarios:
// - Infrared LED controls multiple motors in a single train
// - More than one 4DBrix WiFi Train Receiver installed in a single train.
// - Combining different motorshields into a single train is also possible (e.g. steam loco with 4DBrix receiver in the front 
//   and an additional "push" waggon in the middle of the train with an L9110 motorshield).

// - motorShieldName: usually the same as the name of the loco. If the 4DBrix WiFi Train Receiver is used, you can choose a different name here. Useful if a train has multiple 4DBrix receivers on board and the motor turning direction is different.
// - motorShieldType: motor shield type
// - minArduinoPower: minimum power setting for Arduino based motor shields
// - maxArduinoPower: maximum power setting for Arduino based motor shields (max. 1023)
// - configMotorA: turning direction of motor A (1 = forward, -1 = backward, 0 = unused)
// - configMotorB: same for motor B
// - locoAddress: loco that this motor shields is attached to
